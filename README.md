### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer with roughly 3 years of experience. Formerly an administrative assistant, I switched careers during the pandemic. I found free online resources to learn coding on my own (Harvard's CS50 course, FreeCodeCamp, and The Odin Project), and spent the next year and a half putting together projects of various sizes to showcase my skills. I quickly landed a position at Brightcove, a leading streaming video platform, where I could prove my worth and grow as an engineer. As a member of the Professional Services consulting team, I worked on projects of all sizes, ranging from minor customizations on standardized company products to full-scale SPAs.

In terms of the technologies I like to use, MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS) has been my go-to stack because of how seamless it feels to switch between front-end and back-end.

👉  Check out my [website](https://romainyvernes.dev/) if you want to see some of the projects I've worked on so far.

🔭  Take a look at my [latest project](https://odinbook-social.herokuapp.com/), a Facebook-inspired MERN application.

And feel free to wander around my GitHub to keep up with my latest work.
