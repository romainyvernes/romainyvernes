### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a career switcher and I couldn't be happier I finally took the leap. Formerly an administrative assistant, I decided to get into coding after seeing several acquaintances of mine with a similar background to mine successfully making the transition. I enrolled in Harvard's CS50 course, completed a few certifications from FreeCodeCamp, and built two dozen projects through The Odin Project's curriculum. And after nearly 2 years of hard work and dedication, I am proud to call myself a software engineer.

In terms of the technologies I like to use, MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS) has been my go-to stack because of how seamless it feels to switch between front-end and back-end.

ðŸ‘‰  Check out my [website](https://romainyvernes.dev/) if you want to see some of the projects I've worked on so far.

ðŸ”­  Take a look at my [latest project](https://odinbook-social.herokuapp.com/), a Facebook-inspired MERN application.

And feel free to wander around my GitHub to keep up with my latest work.
