### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a career switcher and I couldn't be happier I finally took the leap. Formerly an administrative assistant, I decided to get into coding after seeing several acquaintances of mine with similar backgrounds successfully making the transition. I enrolled in Harvard's CS50 course, completed a few certifications from FreeCodeCamp, and built two dozen projects through The Odin Project's curriculum. And after 15 months of hard work and self-discipline, I am proud to call myself a self-taught web developer.

I already have a solid command of front-end technologies (I particularly love working with React), and I'm now looking into honing my skills on the back-end side (I've already created a couple of back-end projects, so I'm getting there!).

ðŸ‘‰  Check out my [website](https://romainyvernes.dev/) if you want to see some of the projects I've worked on so far.

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on a MERN application that will recreate some features of Facebook. Stay tuned...

And feel free to wander around my GitHub to keep up with my latest work.
