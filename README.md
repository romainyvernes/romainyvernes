### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a career switcher and I couldn't be happier I finally took the leap. Formerly an administrative assistant, I decided to get into coding after seeing several friends of mine with similar backgrounds successfully making the transition. I enrolled in Harvard's CS50 course, completed a few certifications from FreeCodeCamp, and built two dozen projects through The Odin Project's curriculum. And after 15 months of hard work and self-discipline, I am proud to call myself a self-taught web developer.

I already have a solid command of front-end technologies (I particularly love working with React), and I'm now looking into learning more of the back-end stuff so I can create full-stack apps.

ðŸ‘‰ Check out my [website](https://romainyvernes.herokuapp.com/) if you want to see some of the projects I've worked on so far.

And feel free to wander around my GitHub to keep up with my latest work!
