### Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer specialized in web development. The projects you will see here reflect the variety of pages you may encounter on the web, such as utilities, games, e-commerce sites, or social media platforms. They are meant to showcase my ability to create and maintain smooth, well-responsive pages with their own state management system on the frontend; and to design and build APIs on the backend, while blending the two for a seamless user experience.

ðŸ‘‰ Check out my [website](https://romainyvernes.dev/) if you want to see some of the projects I've worked on so far.

âœ… Take a look at my [latest completed project](https://wispy-night-906.fly.dev/), a Facebook-inspired MERN application.

ðŸ”­ I'm now working on a PERN app that incorporates Redis and Docker, and aims at facilitating communication among filmmakers during the production process ðŸŽ¥
